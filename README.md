# PADLOCK Encryption
It is an encryption software that use an encryption algorith called PAD (developed by @realshash)  
It uses a simple and creative formula for combining Partitions, Alphabets and Difference quantites to form each character  
It is a very volatile system that is very hard to decrypt (use it for very highly sensitive data)  
Still in BETA phase therefore sometimes encrypted text cannot be decrypted again
